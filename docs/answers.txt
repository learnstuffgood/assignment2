4. One reason that git branches are used is to facilitate testing of 
new features without possibly messing up the main code base. Another
reason branches are used is to allow multiple developers to work 
together by allowing each one to have a similar reference point
when developing new features or testing.

5. git status lets you inspect the working directory while git log 
only operates on the committed history.

(I) Inheritance in the context of OOP is the way one bases an 
object or class on another object or class.
(II) Polymorphism in the context of OOP describes the way different
classes can be used with the same interface.
(III) Encapsulation in the context of OOP is the process of 
bundling data and the methods acting on that data into a single unit. 
This is done to provide accessability without revealing complexity, and
also to prevent unauthorized access to the data encapsulated.


9. Integration manager workflows all have their own public and private
repositories that answer to an integration manager, while in Dictator 
and Lieutenant workflows have three levels of repositories: 
One Central, one Dictator, and a number of Lieutenant repositories 
that some developers, not all, are asigned to.

10. Centralized workflows do not handle the division of labor as well
as D&L workflows. A D&L workflow would have checks and balances in
proportion to the larger number of developers (100), while a
centralized workflow would likely result in chaos, and potentially,
death.
